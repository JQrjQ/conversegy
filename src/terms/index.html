                by Conversegy or

                    The Customer agrees that it shall defend, indemnify, save and hold Conversegy harmless from any and all
                    demands,

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">All web design commissions provided by Conversegy to the Customer are subject to the following terms
                    and
                    conditions.</p>

                <h4 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl">2.1 Scope of Work and Price Agreement</h4>

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    Charges for Services to be provided by Conversegy will be defined in the customer’s Project
                    Proposal. Under
                    normal
                    trading circumstances, the Project Proposal
                    will be issued by Conversegy following receipt of a request for quotation from the Customer, which
                    shall
                    identify
                    the scope of work intended.
                </p>

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    Conversegy will provide its quotation which will include the Project Proposal for acceptance or
                    comment by the
                    Customer. Any quote is valid only for 30 days.
                    Once the Project Proposal has been accepted by the Customer, this will then be deemed to be the sole
                    document
                    which will specify the scope of work.
                </p>

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    Where possible and relevant, based upon the information provided by the Customer, such other
                    resources will
                    be
                    identified in the Project Proposal. However, in those circumstances whereby such resources cannot be
                    reasonably
                    identified at the Project Proposal stage, then Conversegy reserves the right to issue an amendment
                    to the
                    Project
                    Proposal as soon as it becomes clear that additional resources might be required, which might
                    include a
                    re-evaluation of the costs quoted.
                </p>

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    The customer agrees that changes required over and above the estimated work or required to be
                    carried out
                    after
                    acceptance of the draft design will be liable to a separate charge. The customer also agrees that
                    Conversegy
                    holds
                    no responsibility for any amendments made by any third party, before or after a design is published.
                </p>

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    Any indication given by Conversegy of a project’s duration is to be considered by the customer to be
                    an
                    estimation.
                    Conversegy cannot be held responsible for any project over-runs, whatever the cause. Estimated
                    project duration
                    should be deemed to be from the date that cleared funds are received by Conversegy for the initial
                    payment or by
                    date confirmed in writing by Conversegy.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl">2.2 Payment Clause</h4>

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    All services require an advance non-refundable deposit of 50% (fifty percent or greater at our
                    discretion)
                    of
                    the project quotation total before the work is supplied to the Customer for review. The remaining
                    will be
                    due
                    upon completion of the work or at stage payment as agreed in the proposal. Work on the project will
                    not
                    commence
                    until Conversegy has received this amount.
                </p>

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    Charges for any additional services over and above the estimated design, will become fully payable
                    at the
                    time
                    of estimate or quotation acceptance. Publication and/or release of work carried out by Conversegy on
                    behalf of
                    the
                    client, may not take place before cleared funds have been received.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl">2.3 Customer Review</h4>

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    Conversegy will provide the Customer with an opportunity to review the appearance and content of the
                    Web site
                    during
                    the design prototype stage.
                </p>

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    The customer agrees to allow Conversegy to place a small credit on printed material exhibition
                    displays,
                    advertisements and/or a link to Conversegy’s own website on the customer’s website. This will
                    usually be in the
                    form
                    of a small logo or line of text placed towards the bottom of the page. The customer also agrees to
                    allow
                    Conversegy
                    to place websites and other designs, along with a link to the client’s site on Conversegy’s own
                    website for
                    demonstration purposes and to use any designs in its own publicity.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl">2.4 Customer Acceptance</h4>

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    At the “sign-off” stage the customer will be presented with the completed design. Such materials
                    will be
                    deemed
                    as acceptable and approved unless the Customer notifies Conversegy to the contrary within 10 working
                    days of the
                    date the materials were made available.
                </p>

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    Invoices will be provided by Conversegy upon completion of any work undertaken. Invoices are due
                    upon receipt.
                    Accounts that remain unpaid thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice will be subject to a
                    service
                    charge
                    of 5% of the outstanding balance per month.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-lg sm:text-2xl">2.5 Default</h4>

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    Accounts unpaid 30 (thirty) days after the date of invoice will be considered in default. If the
                    Customer in
                    default maintains any information or files on Conversegy’s Web space, Conversegy will, at its
                    discretion, remove all
                    such material from its web space. Conversegy is not responsible for any loss of data incurred due to
                    the removal
                    of
                    the service. Removal of such material does not relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay any
                    outstanding
                    charges assessed to the Customer’s account. Customers with accounts in default agree to pay
                    Conversegy
                    reasonable
                    expenses, including legal fees and costs for collection by third-party agencies, incurred by
                    Conversegy in
                    enforcing
                    these Terms and Conditions.

                <p class="text-md sm:text-lg pb-2">
                    Termination of services by the Customer must be requested in writing and signed. Termination will be
                    effective
                    on receipt of such notice. The Customer will be invoiced for design work completed to the date of
                    first

                    of cancellation for payment in full within 30 (thirty) days.

                    about such material. No file sharing or peer to peer software such as IRC bots or illegal MP3 sites

                    Customer
                    sends a written cancellation request. We reserve the right to remove your website if payment is more
                    than
                    two calendar months outstanding and to charge an administration fee of €100 to reconnect service.

                    software and
                    technical support offered by the third party and is not responsible for any technical deficiencies
                    or breaks
                    in service when they occur. Should technical support be required by a client, an email should be
                    sent to
                    Conversegy and the matter raised will be discussed with the relevant third party partner.</p>

                    requirements of the
                    client or that an increased level of technical support is necessary, Conversegy will endeavour to
                    find a

                    will advise
                    and assist with any data extraction and transfer work subject to Conversegy’s standard hourly rates.

                    following policy to

                    detriment of
                    other clients of Conversegy, then Conversegy reserves the right to immediately suspend that site.
                    This policy will
                    only be implemented in extreme circumstances. Customers may be offered an option whereby Conversegy

                    Domain to another person (the “Transferee”) the Client will procure that the Transferee agrees in
